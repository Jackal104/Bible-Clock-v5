And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn\u2019t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person\u2019s failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to him."

Can\u2019t you see that it\u2019s to our advantage that one man dies for the people rather than the whole nation be destroyed?\u201d He didn\u2019t say this of his own accord, but as Chief Priest that year he unwittingly prophesied that Jesus was about to die sacrificially for the nation, and not only for the nation but so that all God\u2019s exile-scattered children might be gathered together into one people."

Good work will get you good pay from the Master, regardless of whether you are slave or free."
