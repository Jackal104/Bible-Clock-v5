All of your sacrifices and offerings must be taken there, including sacrifices to please the Lord[a] and any gift you promise or voluntarily give him. That's where you must also take one tenth of your grain, wine, and olive oil,[b] as well as the first-born of your cattle, sheep, and goats.[c] You and your family and servants will eat your gifts and sacrifices[d] and celebrate there at the place of worship, because the Lord your God has made you successful in everything you have done. And since Levites will not have any land of their own, you must ask some of them to come along and celebrate with you.Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice. If the Lord has blessed you and given you enough cows or sheep or goats, then you can butcher one of them where you live. You can eat it just like the meat from a deer or gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat. But you must not eat the blood of any animal\u2014let the blood drain out on the ground.",
