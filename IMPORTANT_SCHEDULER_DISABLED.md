# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Advanced Scheduler Disabled

## Issue Fixed: Display Going Blank

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Problem:** Advanced scheduler was causing display conflicts and making the screen go blank repeatedly  
**Solution:** Permanently disabled AdvancedScheduler in ServiceManager

## Changes Made:

1. **src/service_manager.py** - Lines 47, 77, 143, 727
   - Disabled `AdvancedScheduler()` initialization 
   - Disabled all scheduler jobs (verse_updates, pagination_check, etc.)
   - Added null checks for scheduler methods
   - Simple updater thread now handles all display updates

2. **src/display_health_monitor.py** - Lines 172, 105-127
   - Added scheduler conflict detection
   - Automatically kills competing processes
   - Monitors for multiple bible clock processes

## Why This Matters:
- The advanced scheduler was running multiple competing update loops (every 10-30 seconds)
- This caused race conditions and display conflicts
- Simple updater is more reliable and prevents blank screens
- Health monitor now automatically prevents future conflicts

## DO NOT RE-ENABLE THE SCHEDULER
Re-enabling the advanced scheduler will cause the display to go blank again.
The simple updater provides all necessary functionality without conflicts.

## Current Status:
✅ Display stable and working  
✅ Simple updater handling verse updates  
✅ Health monitor preventing conflicts  
✅ Self-healing system active
