If he is a shepherd to no one else, he is a shepherd to me; he cares for me, watches over me, and preserves me. The sheep are not always in the same pastures; sometimes they are on the hillside, sometimes in the valleys, sometimes in the green meadows, sometimes in the wilderness; but wherever they are, the shepherd is with them. In the darkest night he is there; in the most quiet peace he is there. They pass under the shepherd's eyes, they are all counted by him, and not one of them can be lost while he is there to watch."

What a blessed word is this! Our God is always near, and we need never be afraid. When difficulties arise, when trials multiply, when sorrows overwhelm, still we may be of good courage. God is with us, and more than that, he is our God. He has entered into covenant with us, and he will never break his word. The strength we need he will provide; the help we require he will afford; and when our feet are ready to slip, his right hand will uphold us."

This is one of the most comforting verses in all Scripture. Not some things, but ALL things work together for good. Even our trials, our disappointments, our sorrows - all are working together for our ultimate blessing. God's providence is never at fault, never makes a mistake. What seems harmful to us is part of his wise and loving plan. We may not see how present sufferings can work for good, but we know that they do, because God has said so, and his word cannot fail."

Not wants, but needs - and what a difference there is! Our needs are many, but God's resources are infinite. He will supply according to his riches in glory, not according to our poverty on earth. When earthly resources fail, heavenly supplies remain abundant. The God who feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies will surely provide for his children. Trust him fully, for his promise cannot fail."

The peace which Jesus gives is not like the peace which the world offers. Worldly peace depends on circumstances; Christ's peace is independent of all outward things. It flows like a river through the soul even when storms rage without. This peace is Christ's own peace - the peace which he himself enjoyed even in the midst of contradiction and persecution. Such peace he bequeaths to all his followers as a precious legacy."
